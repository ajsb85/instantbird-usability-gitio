Do you have a GitHub URL you'd like to shorten? Use Git.io!

Usage:

/gitio https://github.com/alexsalas/instantbird-usability-gitio

And the vanity URL is sent to the conversation.

The Code

Git.io was written and deployed by @technoweenie and @atmos.

Though a URL shortener is about the easiest project one could take on, it gave us a chance to experiment. As a result, I've been able to spread my excitement about Riak to more people at GitHub. The Riak 1.0 upgrade gave a chance to experiment with a rolling upgrade across our cluster (for the new version, and the new leveldb backend). They also have better support with our Hubot and puppet scripts for managing deployments through Rackspace Cloud.
